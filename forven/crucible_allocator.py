"""CRUX-1: value-ranked allocation of the crucible research budget.

Diagnosis (2026-07-06 crucible review): 1,512 crucibles produced 3,971
strategies for 6 survivors (0.15%) while consuming ~85% of weekly agent
compute (~250 develop tasks per survivor). Both dispatchers were economically
blind — crucible_planner iterated the active pool oldest-first and the
hypothesis-promotion loop's score collapsed to random for the (majority)
zero-children candidates. Every recent systemic pathology (585-task fruitless
dispatch loop, substrate-mismatch phantom class, dark-starved families) is a
symptom of dispatching without a value model.

This module is the shared brain for both dispatchers:

- crucible_value_score(): pure scoring function — true stage survival of the
  crucible's children dominates, family survival priors (90d,
  survivor-weighted) steer cold-start ranking, fruitless/failed develops and
  yield-free depth are penalized, staleness decays.
- develop budget: a hard daily cap on develop_candidate-family dispatches
  shared by BOTH loops (in-flight caps bound concurrency, not daily spend).
- trade-mode directive: a quota of daily develops carry an explicit
  short/both authoring requirement — the 2026-07-05 graveyard audit found
  shorts net-positive in EVERY regime bucket while generation ran 9:1 long.
- orthogonal-data directive: a quota of daily develops must drive their
  primary signal from a non-price enrichment column (funding/basis/OI/
  positioning/IV) — OHLCV-only indicator space is the graveyard's most-mined
  field, while these columns carry years of history and near-zero
  exploration (the funding family was dark-starved by a symbol-path bug
  until 2026-07-03).

Knobs live in research settings under hypothesis_discipline
(crucible_daily_develop_budget, crucible_short_mode_quota_pct,
crucible_orthogonal_data_quota_pct).
