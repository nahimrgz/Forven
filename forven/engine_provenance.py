"""Backtest-engine provenance: version every stats-affecting artifact.

The problem this solves: after an engine fix (exit ordering, fee model, sizing,
indicator math, ...) every previously persisted backtest / validation verdict
describes a DIFFERENT engine than the one running today. Comparing those stale
numbers against fresh ones silently corrupted gate decisions — strategies were
archived on verdicts the current engine would never produce, and every engine
fix required a MANUAL re-baseline sweep plus manual triage of wrongly-killed
strategies.

The contract:

* every persisted backtest artifact (backtest_results.config_json), gauntlet
  settings snapshot / artifact payload, strategy verdict blob and gate-rejection
  record is stamped with ``BACKTEST_ENGINE_VERSION`` at write time;
* a STATS-AFFECTING engine change bumps ``BACKTEST_ENGINE_VERSION`` (with a
  required ``ENGINE_VERSION_LOG`` entry — a unit test enforces the changelog);
* readers treat a stamped artifact from a DIFFERENT version as STALE: it is
  never compared against fresh numbers (policy._extract_gauntlet_verdict_payloads
  refuses it), the promotion gate blocks with the counter-exempt
  ``stale_engine_artifacts`` reason code, and the gauntlet sweep
  (engine.requeue_stale_engine_artifacts) automatically re-queues the strategy
  for re-validation — including reviving strategies the old engine archived;
* artifacts WITHOUT a stamp (written before this module shipped) are
  grandfathered as current — the operator's last manual re-baseline is the
  baseline for pre-provenance history. Staleness only ever fires on an explicit
  version mismatch, mirroring the params_hash convention in gauntlet/status.py.

Bump discipline: bump for changes that alter backtest STATISTICS (fills, fees,
slippage, sizing, exit ordering, indicator math, metric formulas). Do NOT bump
for pure refactors, logging, UI, or performance work — a bump re-queues every
active strategy's validation suite, which is exactly the point, and exactly the
cost.

This module must stay import-light (constants + dict helpers only): it is
imported from api_core, policy and the gauntlet engine, so any heavy import
here would create cycles.
