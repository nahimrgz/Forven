"""AST-based static guard for AI-generated strategy source (P2-T02).

Single-pass walk over the parsed AST that records ALL violations without
bailing on the first. Never executes user code — uses `ast.parse` only.

Public API:
- :func:`scan_source` — scan an in-memory source string
- :func:`scan_file`   — read+scan a file from disk

Both return an :class:`AstReport`. `ok` is True iff no findings were
recorded. Findings cover: imports NOT on the allowlist (the import gate is an
allowlist of numeric/data libs + pure-computation stdlib + the strategy-facing
forven API — see :data:`ALLOWED_IMPORTS` / :data:`ALLOWED_FORVEN_PREFIXES`),
re-export smuggling (`from pandas.io.common import os`) and attribute traversal
to a dangerous module (`pd…subprocess.run`), dynamic execution constructs
(`eval`/`exec`/`compile`/`__import__('…')`/`getattr(__builtins__, …)`), and size
caps (file bytes + line count).

NOT a complete trust boundary by itself — a static scan can never be. It is
defense-in-depth that shrinks the surface; the real boundary is out-of-process
execution (Phase 2, see the 2026-06 security-hardening plan).
