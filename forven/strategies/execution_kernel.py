"""The single execution engine shared by the backtest and the live/paper scanner.

Given an ordered OHLCV frame, a :class:`DirectionalSignals` payload, and a
normalized execution profile (``ec``), :func:`simulate` produces the closed trades
and the still-open positions of a strategy. It owns the whole execution model:

  * entries fill at the NEXT bar's open (signal on bar ``i`` → fill on bar ``i+1``),
  * position sizing via :mod:`forven.strategies.sizing` (fraction/atr/kelly/fixed/full),
  * exits evaluated intrabar against each bar's high/low — fixed stop (gap-through
    fill at the stop level), take-profit (fill at the target), trailing stop
    (ratcheted on the prior bar's extreme) and time-stop (fill at the bar open),
  * signal-driven exits (fill at the bar open),
  * net fee+slippage drag (``round_trip_drag``) subtracted from gross before sizing,
  * one PnL convention: ``pnl_pct = (price_return*sign*leverage - drag) * size_fraction``.

Two consumers drive the SAME code:

  * the backtest runs :func:`simulate` once over the full history and force-closes
    any open position at the final bar (see ``backtest._run_directional_signal_series_with_controls``);
  * the live/paper scanner runs :func:`simulate` over its history each newly-closed
    bar and acts on the difference vs its recorded trades, leaving the open position
    live (it does NOT force-close).

Because :func:`simulate` walks bars left-to-right and finalizes each trade at its
exit bar, running it over a growing prefix and collecting newly-closed trades
reproduces the full-history result trade-for-trade — the replay-safety property the
scanner relies on, proven in ``tests/test_execution_parity.py``.

    the live position and the backtest force-closes at the final bar. ``closed_gross`` is the
