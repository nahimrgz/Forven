"""Shared position-sizing math — the SINGLE source of truth for how a strategy's
execution profile maps to a position size.

Used by BOTH the backtest engine (``forven/strategies/backtest.py``) and the
live/paper scanner (``forven/scanner.py``). Keeping one implementation is what
makes paper/live execution *mirror* the backtest: identical ``sizing_mode``
formulas, identical defaults, identical leverage handling. If you change a
formula here, both the backtest and live/paper sizing change together — which is
exactly the invariant we want (so a backtest's returns are achievable live).

The math is fractional and stateless, mirroring the backtest: a trade's effect
on equity is ``gross * size_fraction`` where ``gross = price_move_pct * leverage``.
``position_units`` converts that fractional intent into concrete contract units
for a live order: ``units = equity * leverage * size_fraction / entry_price``.
For the risk-based modes (fraction/atr) leverage cancels out (size_fraction
already divides by it), so the dollar risk is leverage-invariant; for
full/fixed/kelly, leverage multiplies the notional, exactly as the backtest's
``gross * leverage`` does.
