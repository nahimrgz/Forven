"""Reset paper trading — wipe the paper/testnet trade history so the system starts
fresh on the corrected engine.

The garbage trades made while the engine was broken (full-notional / drifted signals /
no stops / whipsaw fills) live in the `trades` table; paper sessions and equity are
DERIVED from it, so deleting the paper trades resets the rollup, the per-session
equity (back to the starting capital), and the chart's trade markers automatically.

Keeps: the strategies themselves, their backtest metrics, and REAL live trades.

SAFE: read-only report by default; --apply BACKS UP the DB first, then deletes.

    python scripts/reset_paper_trades.py                 # report what WOULD be deleted
    python scripts/reset_paper_trades.py --apply         # back up + delete paper trades
    python scripts/reset_paper_trades.py --apply --include-live   # also wipe live trades

Tip: hit Emergency Halt / pause the paper service before --apply so the scanner
doesn't open a fresh trade mid-reset.
