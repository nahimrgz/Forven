"""The daemon must publish the price snapshot BEFORE the (possibly slow) risk cycle.

publish_price_snapshot stamps updated_at at publish time, so publishing at the END of a slow
tick stamped a now-stale price as fresh — a lag the consumers' 120s age gate can't see (it
filled a paper short ~$80 off the candle). This pins the ordering so it can't silently regress.
