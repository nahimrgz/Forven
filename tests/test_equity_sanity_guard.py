"""Guard against implausible equity readings arming a false kill-switch.

Reproduces the incident where a bad ``books_aggregate`` read (~4.3e23) became the
high-water mark and latched a permanent false kill-switch (drawdown ~100% against
the garbage peak). The guard must (a) reject such samples before they touch the
risk state, (b) self-heal an already-corrupted stored HWM, and (c) leave normal
behaviour — including legitimate kill-switch firing — intact.
